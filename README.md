Problem Description (from http://www.math.ucla.edu/~rombach/PIC16_project2.pdf):

This engine uses a list of urls as its “internet"

•The engine creates a network based on links between the pages in the source code of any page

•The engine understands the meaning of quotation marks

•The engine does pagerank on the sub-network of the pages that contain the search term from the user, and then lists the first few, together with a small snippet of the text on the page. This should be a snippet that contains the highest concentration of the search term words.
